# Project-Buckets
Golf-like Puzzle-ish game. Build this game in Unity.

Obviously, this project is nowhere near complete. Nothing is final. Especially those graphics - those are just default Unity geometric sprites!
## Focus list:
- The game will look fine on both 16:9 devices and narrower 18:9 and 19:9 devices. 16:10 devices are less common, but the game will still be playable on these devices as well.
> Basically, the playable area will consist in a 16:9 space, but on larger displays, the area will appear to extend.
- Text will be readable on all devies.
> Text Meshes will be used on buttons (instead of button sprites) and in menus.
- Version 1.0 may still have deprecated scripts in its release, just in case bugs arise and the scripts need to be used. These scripts, should any exist, will be removed within two minor releases.

## Notes:
The version tag is temporary. It may look strange on a non-16:9 device, but that is what I am using to test with, and it would be a waste of time to optimize a silly label like that to work on different aspect ratios ;)
